  - Added support for returning affected rows from update methods in peer classes. (Hans)

  Oct. 24, 2004 - CVS

    Big Changes:
  - Removed Transaction class, refactoring functionality into Creole
    Connection classes (Dave Lawson)
  - New NodePeer for handling hierarchies (Dave Lawson)

    Minor Changes:
    [Generated Classes]
    - Peer::populateObject() method deprecated (will remove in Propel 1.1) in
    favor of Object->hydrate()
    - Removed Peer::buildCriteria() method in favor of Object->buildCriteria()
    and Object->buildPkeyCriteria()
    - Peer doSelect*() family of methods now [consistently] only takes
    Criteria objects for parameter.
    - No more support in generated Peer classes for using Criteria with
    different DB name.
    - Date/time setter methods now perform a strtotime() conversion on passed
    data and throw a PropelException is such a conversion cannot be performed.
  - New copy() method replaces non-working __clone() impl.  __clone() unused due
    to desire to have a way to copy objects w/o necessarying copying rows.
