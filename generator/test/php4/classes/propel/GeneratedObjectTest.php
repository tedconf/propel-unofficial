/**
 * Tests the generated Object classes.
 *
 * This test uses generated Bookstore classes to test the behavior of various
 * object operations.  The _idea_ here is to test every possible generated method
 * from Object.tpl; if necessary, bookstore will be expanded to accommodate this.
 *
 * The database is relaoded before every test and flushed after every test.  This
 * means that you can always rely on the contents of the databases being the same
 * for each test method in this class.  See the BookstoreDataPopulator::populate()
 * method for the exact contents of the database.
