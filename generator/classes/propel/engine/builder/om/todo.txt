- Make the getPackage() methods always return the current package of the class being built.
This will mean we'll probably need a getBasePackage() which is the package that the user
specifies in the schema or in ${propel.targetPackage} prop.
*** This should now be done, but has not been tested.  Instead of getBasePackage() we now have methods
like getPeerBuilder() that will return the [base] peer builder class and getStubPeerBuilder() which will
return a stub peer builder.  That way we can quickly get classnames, packages, etc. from other members of
the builder family.

- Add error handling to the builderFactory() method so we can properly flag failures to load those files.
*** There is currently error handling in Phing::import() to flag inability to load classes.  We may need to 
add some better error messages in the builderFactor() specifically.
*** builderFactory is broken anyway since it's using Phing::import($clazz); with $clazz not being defined anywhere [David]
