
- Make the getPackage() methods always return the current package of the class being built.
This will mean we'll probably need a getBasePackage() which is the package that the user
specifies in the schema or in ${propel.targetPackage} prop.

- Investigate whether to make some convience methods for factory:  getNewPeerBuilder() rather than factoryBuilder('peer').
If not, then at least make some constants (e.g. DataModelBuilder::PEER_BUILDER) so we don't have to rely on raw strings
to instnatiate classes. 

- Add error handling to the builderFactory() method so we can properly flag failures to load those files.
